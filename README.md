NLTK library, which can be used for various natural language processing tasks. It may be useful for preprocessing text data before training with PyTorch.   

Install torchvision and torchaudio separately due to potential compatibility issues
```bash
  pip install torchvision
  pip install torchaudio
```
## follow the steps


- Run the default.py   -- to set up the project dependencies
- Run the train.py     -- to train the model
- Run the chat.py      -- to start running the application
